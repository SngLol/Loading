A Shell Script game made by SngLol	
Inspired by slow loading screens

Game Purpose	
You face a non-loading progress bar		
You press buttons on your keyboard to manually make it load		
You buy uppgrades in the shop to make the progress bar load faster	
The currency of the game is percentage from the progress bar	
When you finnished the first progress bar you will face a bigger one	
If you go below 1% you will return to the first bar		
Load yourself to the end of the second progress bar in order to win the game	

This is hopefully a fully working game which will be improved by time		
Please send me your thoughts and I may grant you your wishes

"Install"		
Put the folder named "Loading" in your home folder	
/home/user/		
It will now look like this	
/home/user/Loading/		

Starting The Game Properly	
In the Loading folder you'll find start.sh	
right-click it and click "Properties"		
go to "Permissions" and "Allow executing file as program"		
right-click the file again and click "Make link"	
drag the new link file to your desktop	
Now do the same thing for SelfLoad.sh		
Dubble-click the start.sh link file and choose "Run in Terminal"	
And the same for SelfLoad.sh	
if this does not show up...
